# Weather-Forecast

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a weather forecast website that displayed the temperature, wind, and humidity of any city entered
- This webpage includes a five day forecast with information of the weather each day
- From this project, I learned used the Open Weather Api to fetch all of my weather data and display it in the screen
- For the styling of this project, I used Bootstrap to style the entire webpage, also calling my CSS for minimal changes
- For each weather condition, an icon is shown to represent any rain, snow, clouds, or sun for the day

## Features

For this project, I built a five day weather forecast using a https://openweathermap.org/ Api and Bootstrap Styles. In this application, I have a form to enter any city, and a submit button which generates a forecast for that city along with an icon to represent the conditons. Below this form, I have some preselected popular cities to click, and submit to view the weather conditions and forecast.
